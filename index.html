            <p>I was born  May 31,1981 in Riga, Latvia. When I was 15 my family moved to Denver. I went to South High school, where I made a lot  friends. When I was 16 had my first job as carrier. After few years I began to work  at Kaiser as a cashier. While working at Kaiser, I went to school, and received pharmacy tech license, and was promoted   to pharmacy tech position. I worked as pharmacy tech for 10 years, then had been promoted to pharmacy buyer position. Iâ€™m married for two year to my wife Irina.
